ESLint configurations for TypeScript and/or React projects. This project is
invisioned as a replacement of AirBnB ESLint Configs, which are completely
neglected by AirBnB lately, and are deaf to well justified complaigns of users.
Thus, the aims of this project are:

- Code style similar to that of AirBnB configs + Some opionated improvements on
  top of them.

- Support of the latest ESLint releases.

- Timely upgrades of dependencies.
